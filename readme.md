forum web application


Lets make the basics of a forum web application, where users can share their opinions!

There are two kinds of users, moderators and standard ones - we call them posters. Every user has a name and a date on which they joined the forum. Moderators can have one of three different roles (Server admin, developer, community moderator). Every poster has the option to disable the adult filter, which usually protects them from unmoderated content.

A forum consists of a few topics. A topic has a title and consists of a lot of comments. All comments have a creation date, message and ID. Creation dates are set automatically upon creation. Every comment should be moderated and we want to keep track of which moderator checked it.

Users want to be able to read the comments of a topic. By default they only get to see the moderated comments, however, if they disabled the adult filter, they are able to see everything. Moderators always see all comments.

To announce the “Mod of the month”, the owner of the forum wants to be able to get the moderator who moderated the most comments across all topics.
